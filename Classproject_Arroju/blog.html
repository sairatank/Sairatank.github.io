          <p align="container">
                    The computer science part gives a engineer much needed wisdom on how software makes computer system run and perform tasks. There are a few different types of employers computer engineers could work for today.

The first is for a major computer company actually designing whole computer systems for say Compaq or Macintosh. Then there are the type that works for computer components such as peripheral systems and microchips such as Intel. Then there are the engineers that design everyday electronic components such as bank machines and cell phones.

The job outlook of computer engineering is very good. More and more computer systems are being created every day and the demand for computer engineers is just going to keep on growing.

For example Chris Kolnik (who is- studying to become a computer engineer) says that there is no end in sight to the growth the computer industry.

Some advantages of being a computer engineer is that you use your creativity when working on a project and can express yourself through the computer.

Another advantage is the good pay, it is one of the highest paying fields straight out of college. Their are some disadvantages also like working at a computer all day and being inside the whole time.

Another disadvantage is working on the same project for a long time and that can get boring sometimes if you don’t have a lot of patients. I want to be a computer engineer cause I think that computers are very interesting machines and they are the wave of the future.

I also like programming computers and making computer games and so forth. I would like to be a computer engineer mainly cause I want to do something on the cutting edge of technology and computers are the way to go.

          <p align="container">
                    Computer engineering is a relatively new field of engineering and is one of the fastest growing fields today. Computer engineering is one of today’s most technologically based jobs.


The field of computer engineering combines the knowledge of electrical engineering and computer science to create advanced computer systems. Computer engineering involves the process of designing and manufacturing computer central processors, memory systems, central processing units, and of peripheral devices.

Computer engineers work with CAD(computer aided design) programs and different computer languages so they can create and program computer systems.
